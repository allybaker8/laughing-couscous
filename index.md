## **Live Vehicles**

Live vehicle view provides a real-time view of every vehicle included in your fleet. The live vehicle action panel provides several tools to quickly locate an active vehicle within the map. For snow plows and other vehicles with sensors (sweepers, etc.) the current sensor status is displayed for all live vehicles.


* Selecting a vehicle from the action panel will pan the map and highlight the vehicle.
* The action panel updates in real-time and displays the last message received for the vehicle.
* Vehicles with messages received during the last three (3) hours are highlighted in light blue within the action panel.
* Selecting a vehicle from the map will show a pop-up menu with the last message received for the the vehicle.
* Filtering the list of live vehicles by category will filter the map.
    * i.e. Click Plow to only see plows in the map.
    * i.e. Click Sweeper to only see sweepers in the map.

![Live Vehicles](/img/livevehicles.png)
**Other notes:**

* Vehicle message interval is controlled by Networkfleet configuration. For plows a 15 second reporting interval is strongly recommended. Please contact Networkfleet support to adjust the reporting interval. Also please note faster reporting intervals will increase data fees with Networkfleet.
* Live vehicle breadcrumbs are styled in the map based on their category and whether they are moving or idle.
* Live vehicles that are treating (i.e. plow down, spreader on, brush on) will be highlighted with a yellow circle.

## Historical Vehicles

The historical vehicle view provides tools to search for vehicle breadcrumbs captured over time. There are three basic search filters that can be applied to historical vehicles (**Date**, **Vehicles**, **Location**). You are required to provide a date filter for all historic searches. The results of your search will be shown in a table and within the map. The table and map are interactive, clicking on a record in the table will pan the map and clicking on a breadcrumb from the map will highlight the record in the table. The results table also allows you to sort results on any of the columns (Vehicle, Role, Time, Heading, Speed, Sensor 1, Sensor 2).

**Notes:**

* You can combine filters to find specific breadcrumbs of interest.
* Breadcrumb searches are limited to 10,000 records. If you select a large amount of breadcrumbs you will receive the first 10,000 breadcrumbs that meet your criteria.

# Dashboard

The dashboard provides real-time performance metrics during an active snow event. You can review overall event statistics for previous events, but many of the features are only active during a snow event.

**Event Details:**
The top portion of the dashboard shows key event information (Event Name, Event Start Date, End Date, Duration, Average Temperature, Precipitation).
![Dashboard](/img/dashboard.png)
**Event Statistics:**
This table and chart displays percent complete by priority and a break down of treatment (in miles) over several recent time frames (last hour, 3 hours, and since the beginning of the event).

**Event Trends:**
This chart shows how percent complete has changed over time. This allows you to measure your average cycle time for each priority (i.e. typically three hours of work will result in 50% of priority 1 streets receiving treatment).
![Event Trends](/img/eventtrends.png)
Each line represents a priority, clicking on the line will show the percent complete recorded at that moment in time.

**Current Activity:**
This table displays many vehicles in your fleet have their ignition on and how many routes have a vehicle deployed on them.

**Vehicles By Priority:**
This table shows what priority your vehicles are currently deployed on.
![Vehicles By Priority](/img/vehbypriority.png)
**Last Vehicle Message:**
This is a simple table that updates whenever a new vehicle breadcrumb is received by the system. You can sort the table by each of the columns. The first column (gear) will highlight blue and spin when a recent breadcrumb message is received. Please note this only loads messages received after the dashboard is opened.
![Last Vehicle Message](/img/lastvehiclemessage.png)
**Weather:**
An hourly and daily weather forecast is provided by Dark Sky. You can click on the Powered by Dark Sky link to visit [darksky.com](http://darksky.com/) for more weather details.
![Weather](/img/weather.png)
**Routes:**
This table shows the current number of passes, and the total number of passes performed on each route during the selected snow event.
![Routes](/img/routes.png)* * *

## Events

Event management is a key feature which supports the dashboard metrics. This page is used to start and end snow events and capture snow event updates. Snow events are required to show recent treatment information to the public.

**New Event**
Starting an event will impact the internal map, the internal dashboard, and the public application.

* **Internal map: **After an event is started the internal map view will show street segments based on the last time a plow has treated a street segment.
* **Dashboard: **After an event is started the dashboard will start calculating statistics. The statistics shown are specific to the snow event.
* **Public Site: **After an event is started the “treatment” view displayed in the public application will begin showing treatment information.

![Event Start](/img/Event_Start.gif)

**Event Updates**
Event updates provide a way to document the snow removal process during an active snow event.
![Event Updates](/img/eventupdates.png)
**End Event**
Starting an event will impact the internal map, the internal dashboard, and the public application.

* **Internal map: **Ending an event will clear the map view that shows street segments based on the last time a plow has treated a street segment.
* **Dashboard: **Ending an event will stop the dashboard from calculating statistics.
* **Public Site: **Ending an event will stop the public application from showing the “treatment” view.
